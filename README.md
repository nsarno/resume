### Experience

#### Flippa | Head of Engineering, 2019

As the Head of Engineering, I am playing a critical role in the growth of the business by enabling efficient product delivery, data collection and visualization, hiring and management. The product and engineering department is often relied on by other areas of the business which requires me to have a deep understanding of other functions of the business like sales, marketing or customer support.

#### Flippa | Software Engineer, 2015 - 2018

As a senior software engineer, I have continuously led projects to maintain and enhance the marketplace. I have learnt how to build maintanable and scalable web application as well as how to deal with tech debt and legacy codebases.

#### Washos | Software Engineer (Remote Freelance), 2015

> Arnaud is a fast learner. He jumped in a massive Rails code base at @washos and has immediately been involved in critical customer facing features.

#### Quanta Computing | Software Engineer, 2013 - 2014

As the first engineer, I heavily contributed to building the main solution from the ground up, a SaaS platform for the performance monitoring of eCommerce websites. After a few months of starting the project, we launched and sold the solution to a number of eCommerce companies including some of the most reputable in France and Europe.
The platform was mainly built using Ruby on Rails and javascript, with an accent on efficient data storage and querying given the sheer volume of data collected.
